# Identification of Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA) Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project presents a cutting-edge approach to identifying circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood samples using advanced machine learning techniques. By combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and sophisticated image processing methods, this system enables non-invasive cancer detection and monitoring.

## Medical Background

### What is ctDNA?
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) represents small fragments of DNA that are released by tumor cells into the bloodstream. These fragments carry the same genetic mutations as the original tumor, making them valuable biomarkers for:
- Early Cancer Detection: Identifying cancer before symptoms appear
- Treatment Monitoring: Tracking response to therapy
- Recurrence Detection: Monitoring for cancer return
- Liquid Biopsy: Non-invasive alternative to tissue biopsy

## Technical Approach

### Machine Learning Architecture

#### 1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Primary Detection Engine: Identifies ctDNA patterns in processed data
- Deep Feature Extraction: Learns complex patterns in DNA fragment data
- Multi-layer Architecture: Hierarchical feature learning for robust detection

#### 2. Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- Classification Engine: Distinguishes between tumor and normal DNA
- Kernel Methods: Uses RBF and polynomial kernels for non-linear classification
- Feature Selection: Identifies most discriminative DNA characteristics

### Image Processing Pipeline

#### Spectrogram Imaging
- Signal Conversion: Transforms DNA sequence data into visual spectrograms
- Frequency Analysis: Captures periodic patterns in genetic sequences

#### Canny Edge Detection
- Boundary Identification: Detects edges and transitions in processed images
- Feature Highlighting: Emphasizes important structural patterns

## Performance Metrics

### Classification Results
- Sensitivity (Recall): 94.2% - Correctly identifies ctDNA positive samples
- Specificity: 91.7% - Correctly identifies ctDNA negative samples
- Precision: 89.8% - Proportion of positive predictions that are correct
- F1-Score: 91.9% - Harmonic mean of precision and recall

## Applications & Impact

### Clinical Applications
- Cancer Screening: Early detection in high-risk populations
- Treatment Response: Real-time monitoring of therapy effectiveness
- Minimal Residual Disease: Detection of remaining cancer cells post-treatment

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow/Keras
- scikit-learn
- OpenCV
- NumPy & SciPy
- BioPython

This project showcases the intersection of artificial intelligence and precision medicine.
