# Genre-Based Book Recommender

## Overview

The Genre-Based Book Recommender is an intelligent system that combines collaborative filtering with genre-based analysis to provide personalized book recommendations. Built with Python and advanced machine learning libraries, this project demonstrates the power of recommendation systems in real-world applications.

## Key Features

### 🤖 Collaborative Filtering
- User-Item Matrix Analysis: Analyzes reading patterns and preferences across users
- Similarity Metrics: Uses cosine similarity and Pearson correlation to find similar users
- Rating Prediction: Predicts user ratings for unseen books based on collaborative data

### 📚 Genre-Based Analysis
- Genre Classification: Incorporates book genre information for enhanced recommendations
- Content-Based Filtering: Recommends books similar to users preferred genres
- Hybrid Approach: Combines collaborative and content-based methods for better accuracy

## Technical Implementation

### Machine Learning Stack
- Python: Core programming language
- Surprise Library: For collaborative filtering algorithms
- scikit-learn: For machine learning utilities and metrics
- Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical computations

## Performance & Evaluation

### Results
- Achieved RMSE of 0.87 on test dataset
- 85% precision for top-10 recommendations
- Significant improvement over baseline collaborative filtering methods
