# From Electronics to AI: My Journey as an ML Developer

## How curiosity turned into a career building intelligent systems

Hi, I'm Ashwin Rajakannan, an AI/ML Developer specializing in NLP and data engineering. If you told my undergraduate self that I'd be building transformer models and data pipelines a few years later, I would have been skeptical. But here I am, and this is my story.

## The Foundation: Electronics to Software

My journey started with a **B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering** from SRM Institute. Like many engineering students, I was fascinated by how systems workâ€”circuits, signals, processors. But somewhere along the way, I discovered something even more intriguing: **how machines could learn**.

That curiosity led me to pursue an **M.E in Software Engineering at Anna University's College of Engineering, Guindy**. This wasn't just a degree change; it was a mindset shift. I went from building hardware systems to creating intelligent software that could adapt, learn, and improve.

## First Breakthrough: Cancer Detection with AI

During my academic journey, I worked on a project that would define my passion for machine learning: **Identifying Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA) using CNNs and SVMs**.

The problem was fascinatingâ€”could we use machine learning to detect cancer markers in DNA? We applied:
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for ctDNA detection
- **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** for DNA classification
- **Spectrogram imaging** and digital mapping with Keras
- **Canny edge detection** for feature extraction

The research was [published in IRJET](https://www.irjet.net/archives/V6/i4/IRJET-V6I413.pdf), but more importantly, it taught me something crucial: **AI isn't just about algorithmsâ€”it's about solving real-world problems**.

## Real-World Experience: Building Production Systems

### ðŸ”¹ **Assisto Technologies** (Junior ML Developer, Apr 2023 - Jun 2023)

This was my first deep dive into **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. I worked with state-of-the-art transformer models:
- **MT5, T5, and Byt5** for multilingual text processing
- **Jina AI and Haystack** for optimizing data pipelines
- API integration and model performance tuning

Working with transformers from Hugging Face was like unlocking a superpower. These models could understand context, generate text, and process multiple languagesâ€”all things that seemed like science fiction just a few years ago.

### ðŸ”¹ **SATURAM** (Trainee Data Engineer, Jan 2022 - Jul 2022)

Here, I learned the backbone of ML systems: **data engineering**. Building RESTful APIs with Flask, writing efficient SQL queries, containerizing applications with Docker, and web scraping taught me that:

> **Good ML models need great data pipelines.**

This experience shaped my philosophy: precision in data engineering leads to better model performance.

## The Modern ML Stack: What I Work With

My toolkit has evolved based on what actually works in production:

**Core Programming:**
- **Python** for everything ML/AI
- **C++** for performance-critical components
- **SQL** for data manipulation

**ML/AI Frameworks:**
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (my favorite for NLP)
- **TensorFlow & PyTorch** for deep learning
- **Scikit-learn** for classical ML

**Data Engineering:**
- **Flask** for API development
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data processing
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Azure** for cloud deployment

**AI-Assisted Development:**
- **GitHub Copilot** for code suggestions
- **ChatGPT & Claude** for problem-solving
- **Google Gemini** for research

Yes, I embrace AI tools in my workflow. Why? Because the best developers use the best tools available.

## What Drives Me

I'm not just chasing certifications or adding technologies to my resume. What excites me is:

1. **Building systems that learn and adapt** - Every model that improves its performance feels like a small victory
2. **NLP's potential to break language barriers** - Multilingual models can democratize information access
3. **The intersection of data engineering and ML** - Clean pipelines make everything else possible

As I mentioned in my portfolio:

> *"My achievements aren't measured in numbersâ€”they're reflected in every model that learns, adapts, and performs better than before."*

## What's Next?

I'm actively seeking opportunities where I can:
- Build **production-grade NLP systems**
- Design **scalable data pipelines**
- Work with teams pushing the boundaries of **AI/ML applications**

I'm particularly interested in roles that combine **research and engineering**â€”where I can both experiment with cutting-edge models and deploy them to solve real problems.

## Final Thoughts

The journey from electronics to AI wasn't linear, but every detour taught me something valuable. Whether it was debugging a neural network at 2 AM or optimizing a data pipeline that processed millions of records, each challenge shaped my approach to problem-solving.

**To anyone starting their ML journey:** Don't just learn frameworksâ€”understand the problems you're solving. Build projects that matter to you. And most importantly, stay curious.

Because in this field, curiosity isn't just an advantageâ€”it's the fuel that keeps you going.
